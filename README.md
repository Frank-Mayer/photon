Photon is a web development platform that takes simplicity over complexity. Great for beginners and experts.

This framework is not meant to be used for complex web applications, only for simple pages. The purpose is to improve the general performance and simplify the deployment.

## Use Cases

- Blogs
- Portfolios
- Info pages
- Online documentations
- ...

## Keep it simple

Do you already know the standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stack? Why learn a new one when the existing one is the best? Photon keeps the standard you already know. Templates and subpages are defined in separate HTML files and Photon takes kare of the complicated rest.

## Speed and performance

Most frameworks add too much overhead to simple websites.
Photon does the opposite, it is designed for simple websites.

## It stays in the Browser

The complete code is executed client-side in the browser.
Depending on the settings of the (subpage-) router, some settings on the web server may need to be changed.

## Quick Start

### Use npm or yarn to import the library.

```bash
npm i @frank-mayer/photon
