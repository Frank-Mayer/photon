Photon is a web development platform that takes simplicity over complexity. Great for beginners and experts.

Minimum requirements: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)

Recommended: HTML5, SCSS, TypeScript (ES6)

## Keep it simple

Do you already know the standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stack? Why learn a new one when the existing one is the best? Photon keeps the standard you already know. Components and subpages are defined in separate HTML files.

## Speed and performance

Most frameworks add too much overhead to simple websites.
Photon does the opposite, it is designed for simple websites.

## It stays in the Browser

The complete code is executed client-side in the browser.
Depending on the settings of the (subpage-) router, some settings on the web server may need to be changed.

## Quick Start

### Use npm or yarn to import the library.

```bash
npm i @frank-mayer/photon

```bash
yarn add @frank-mayer/photon
